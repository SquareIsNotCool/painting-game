# [Painting Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/108728025406796/Painting-Game)

A silly little project I'm working on to familiarize myself with Roblox development.

You're welcome to look through the code. I used a few tools like [rojo](https://rojo.space/) and [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/).
I should warn you, though, that the code is an absolute mess since I have no clue what I'm doing! ^^

## Credits

- Music by [Vylet Pony](https://www.vyletpony.com/) is used in the game. Her stuff is absolutely incredible, and you should definitely check it out!
- [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)'s beautiful color palettes are used in this project.
